        Alice (1/5 of $100)
* `createGroupExpense c/600 d/Rent n/Self w/1 n/John w/1 n/Mary /w1`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

## FAQ

**Q**: Why do the expenses in the log not add up exactly to the balance?
**A**: The expenses displayed are rounded to a fixed number of decimal places. This means there may be fractional differences 
between the actual expenses and what is displayed.

Example:
```
If these are the logs stored:
A:      0.122
B:      0.223
Total:  0.345

This is displayed instead when the app is set to show 2 decimal places:
A:      0.12
B:      0.22
Total:  0.35
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
