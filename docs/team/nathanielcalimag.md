### Project: Spend N Split

Spend N Split (SNS) is a **desktop app for managing expense from contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, SNS can get your contact expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
