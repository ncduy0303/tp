### Project: Spend N Split

### Overview
Spend N Split (SnS) is a **desktop app for managing expense from contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, SnS can get your contact expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.


### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jeffrey-jian&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)
* **Enhancements implemented**: Added the ability to use hotkeys to navigate through the app.
* **Contributions to the UG**: to be added soon
* **Contributions to the DG**: to be added soon
* **Contributions to team-based tasks**: to be added soon
* **Review/mentoring contributions**: to be added soon
* **Contributions beyond the project team**: to be added soon

* **New Feature**: Added TransactionList to store transactions.
* **What it does**: Allows the user to store transactions in a list.
* **Justification**: This feature allows the user to view the transactions they have made.
* **Highlights**: This enhancement affects transaction-related commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, where we considered the need for a unique or non-unique list.

* **New Feature**: Added new command `editTransaction`.
* **What it does**: Allows the user to edit an existing transaction in the transaction list.
* **Justification**: This feature allows the user to edit the transactions they have made, in case they made a mistake or would like to update the transaction.
* **Highlights**: This enhancement affects transaction-related commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, whereby we considered what should we allow the user to edit, and how should we allow the user to edit.

* **New Feature**: Added new command `updatePortion`.
* **What it does**: Allows the user to update the portions of a transaction.
* **Justification**: This feature allows the user to update the portions of a transaction, in case they made a mistake or would like to update the portions of a transaction.
* **Highlights**: This enhancement affects transaction-related commands. It required an in-depth judgement about the splitting of the commands for editing transactions, and how to allow the user to update the portions of a transaction. It also required the designing of a 3-in-1 command, which is a command that can be used to add, edit, and delete portions.

* **New Feature**: Added hotkeys to navigate through the app.
* **What it does**: Allows the user to use pre-defined hotkeys to navigate through the app.
* **Justification**: This feature allows the user to navigate through the app faster using the keyboard only, and is especially useful for users who are familiar with the app.
* **Highlights**: This enhancement requires the use of JavaFX and keyCombination to implement the hotkeys. It also required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, whereby we considered the need for hotkeys, and what hotkeys should we implement.

* User Guide:
* Added documentation for the features `editTransaction` and `updatePortion`
* Did cosmetic tweaks to include tips and notes for features regarding "relevant" transactions.

* Developer Guide:
* Added implementation details of the `editTransaction` and `updatePortion` features.

[//]: # (    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]&#40;&#41;)

[//]: # (  * Developer Guide:)

[//]: # (    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.)

[//]: # (  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.)

[//]: # (  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.)

[//]: # (  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.)
